# Android Application and ESP32-Based Robot Control Project

## Project Description
This project includes an Android application and an ESP32-based robot car system. The application features offline functionality, interactive learning, and AI-driven decision-making.

## Features

### Offline Capability
- Fully functional without internet connectivity.
- Performs all processing and learning tasks on the device.

### Interactive Learning
- Engages in dialogues in both Turkish and English.
- Learns from user habits and preferences.

### Android Hardware and Sensor Integration
- Utilizes device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, etc.) and SD card support.

### Face and Object Recognition
- Detects faces and objects using device cameras.

### ESP32-Based Robot Control
- The robot car can be controlled via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
- Makes autonomous decisions using AI.

### User-Friendly Interface
- Intuitive UI for robot control and application settings management.
